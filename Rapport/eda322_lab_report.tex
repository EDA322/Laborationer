\section{Introduction}
(max: 1 page)
\\\\
This part will introduce the reader to the report. 

At the beginning, describe what the purpose of this lab report is. Then describe briefly what each section discusses and finally summarise the most important conclusions. 

\section{Method}
The processor was designed in VHDL-code, using software QuestaSim (ModelSim) for simulation and
XillinxISE for synthesizing. 

\subsection{Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)}

The ALU can take two 8-bit unsigned data words, and perform either of the following operations:
addition, subtraction, bitwise NAND or bitwise NOT. It also has four indicators: {\it Carry},
{\it isOutZero}, {\it Eq} and {\it NotEq}. The {\it Carry}-bit sets to 1 when an overflow occurs
(note that this indicator is only valid when performing addition). The other indicators are
self-explanatory. When choosing what operation to perform on the inputs, you set the two-bit
{\it operation} signal to one of the codes specified in Table~\ref{tab:op}.

We started out with implementing the data flow architecture for a {\it full adder}. A full adder
takes three bits of input, where two of them are the numbers being added and the third one is a
{\it carry-in}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fa}. If at least 2 of the inputs are set to 1, a
{\it carry-out} will be set. The sum output is the remainder of the addition of the three inputs.
With this implementation, we were able to construct a {\it ripple carry adder}, using 8 full adders.
The ripple carry adder could then be used for addition and subtraction in the final ALU-component.
The reader can find the block diagram for the ripple carry adder in Figure~\ref{fig:rca} in
Appendix~\ref{app:fig}.

We had to implement additional circuitry for handling the subtraction of the two inputs. For
that we first defined an internal signal {\it SUB}, that entirely depends on the first bit of the
operation signal. We also defined an 8-bit internal signal, that depends on the {\it exclusive
or} between the second ALU-input and the {\it SUB}-signal. In that way, when the {\it SUB}-signal
is set, the {\it XOR}-gate behaves like an inverter. With the inverted input and the {\it SUB}-signal
going directly to the carry-in of the first full adder, we have the {\it 2 compliment} of the second
input, which is just what is needed for the subtraction to work (see Figure~\ref{fig:sub} in
Appendix~\ref{app:fig} for the block diagram).

Finally, we needed to implement the data flow for a 4-1 {\it multiplexer}, whose purpose is to
select the correct operation for the ALU-output. We did this in VHDL-code by matching the operation
signal to it's corresponding operation, and then sending the signal to the output.

\subsection{Top-level Design}

The top-level design consists of a number of components, such as registers, memory units, ALU's
and multiplexers. What we did was to design these components and then in the end, we connected
them with each other in the data path.

The register is implemented using a D-flip-flop and a 2-to-1 multiplexer. The {\it WE} is the select
signal for the multiplexer and it chooses what should be stored in the flip-flop, which is either
the already stored data or the input data ({\it DATA\_IN}). The register is implemented
generically so that words of any size can be stored. The memory unit consists of an arbitrary number
of registers, also using generic implementation. In the following picture, we can see what happens
when we read and write data to a memory unit:

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figurer/data_memory}
	\label{fig:sim}
\end{figure}

The memory is initially stored with the value `0' (or ``000000000000'' in binary) in address `0'.
{\it WE} is also low, which means writing is disabled. When {\it WE} becomes active, the word
``110011001100'' is stored at the next rising edge of the clock ({\it CLK}) signal.

The bus is implemented using a 4-to-1-multiplexer rather than using tri-state buffers. In this
way, no signals can overload, but there may be multiple select signals active. For this we have
the error signal ({\it ERR}), that activates when at least two select signals are active. The
select signal for the multiplexer and the {\it ERR}-signal are implemented using data flow, where
minimizations of the boolean expressions have been made (see Figure~\ref{fig:enc}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{Figurer/enc4b}
	\caption{The minimized gate logic for the select signals of the bus multiplexer.}
	\label{fig:enc}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Controller}

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figurer/procController_FSM_Mealy}
	\caption{The {\it Final State Machine} of the processor's controller.}
	\label{fig:fsm}
\end{figure}


We divided the controller into three processes; the state combinatorial, state register and
the output combinatorial. In the state combinatorial we took the boolean expression for each 
state and minimized it through Karnaugh diagrams. The finite state machine is implemented in 
mealy state style so the states are dependent on both the current state and the opcode. 
State register has an asynchronous reset which restores the machine state to fetch ({\it FE}). 
The register is controlled by the \emph{master load enable} signal. The output combinatorial 
handles all the control signals. It is minimized in the same manner as the finite state machine.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figurer/controller}
	\caption{Waveform of controller executing some instructions.}
	\label{fig:con}
\end{figure}
\newpage
In figure~\ref{fig:con} we have included a few waveforms showing the processor adding something 
from the memory to the accumulator and then comparing it to another memory cell. It then jumps 
depending on the result of the comparison. From the state we're in the accumulator holds the value 5. 
The instruction to be executed is ADX ACC, DM[DM[4]] which is an indirect addition. The data in the 
memory location is 255, so when the ALU performs the addition the accumulator stores the value 4 and 
we get an overflow. The next instruction, \emph{CMP ACC, DM[8]}, compares the value in the accumulator 
with the value in the memory location. In this case they are both 4 so the EQ signal is set to 1 and 
NEQ is set to 0. When we go to the next instruction, which is JNE 255, we will not jump because NEQ is 
set to 0.

\subsection{Processor's Testbench}

In the testbench we used behavioral VHDL to test our code. We used a reading function to read files which
contained expected outputs for each segmented display. In the architecture we divided all the testing 
of the displays into separate processes. In each process we assert that when a value changes in the display
it is equal to the expected output in the read file. If the assertion fails, the test exits immediately 
with an error message. Inputs were generated by initiating the memory units with the provided memory files.
Then in the test code we added a clock process so that the program could execute.

When we ran the testbench, we saw that we didn't get the expected output. We compared with the
{\it code\_to\_test}-file to see where it went wrong. We found out that in the data path, there were some internal
signals that weren't connected to the right modules, leading to unwanted behaviour. This ultimately solved the
problem and the testbench completed successfully.
